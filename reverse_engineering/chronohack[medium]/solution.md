## Solution Analysis for "Chronohack" Challenge

### Problem Overview
- **Challenge Name**: Chronohack (picoCTF)  
- **Objective**: Guess a 20-character token generated by a server-side Python script to retrieve a hidden flag.  
- **Constraints**: You are limited to 50 guesses per connection to the server.  
- **Token Generation**: The server uses Python’s `random` module, seeded with the current time in milliseconds (`int(time.time() * 1000)`), to generate a 20-character token from a 62-character alphabet (`0-9`, `A-Z`, `a-z`).  

The key insight is that the token generation relies on a predictable seed (the server’s current time). By estimating the server’s timestamp at the moment of token creation, we can replicate the token locally and guess it within the allowed attempts.

### Approach
To solve the challenge, we exploit the time-based seed with the following strategy:  

1. **Understand Token Generation**: Replicate the server’s token generation logic by using the same seed and alphabet.  
2. **Synchronize Timing**: Capture our local time just before connecting to the server as a reference point.  
3. **Account for Delays**: Adjust for network latency and server processing time between our local timestamp and the server’s token generation.  
4. **Generate Guesses**: Create a range of possible tokens based on timestamps around our captured time, covering a small window (e.g., 50 ms).  
5. **Automate Interaction**: Use a tool like `pwntools` to connect to the server, send guesses, and retrieve the flag when the correct token is guessed.  

This approach leverages the predictability of the time-based seed and the 50-guess limit to systematically find the token.

### Solution Steps

#### Step 1: Capture Local Time Before Connecting
- Record the local time in milliseconds just before establishing the server connection using:  
  ```python
  t_start = int(time.time() * 1000)
  ```  
- This timestamp serves as the baseline for guessing the server’s token generation time.

#### Step 2: Connect to the Server
- Use `pwntools` to establish a remote connection:  
  ```python
  r = remote('verbal-sleep.picoctf.net', 56648)
  ```  
- The server generates the token shortly after the connection is made.

#### Step 3: Estimate the Delay
- There’s a small delay between capturing `t_start` and the server generating the token, due to network latency and server processing.  
- Estimate this delay (e.g., 15 ms) based on typical network conditions:  
  ```python
  estimated_delay = 15
  ```  
- This value may need adjustment depending on your network environment.

#### Step 4: Generate Token Guesses
- Create 50 token guesses using timestamps ranging from `t_start + estimated_delay` to `t_start + estimated_delay + 49`:  
  ```python
  guesses = [get_random(20, t_start + estimated_delay + i) for i in range(50)]
  ```  
- Each guess represents a possible server timestamp within a 50 ms window, matching the 50-guess limit.

#### Step 5: Interact with the Server
- Read the server’s initial messages until prompted to guess the token.  
- Send each guess and analyze the response:  
  - **Success**: If the response contains "Congratulations" or the flag (e.g., `picoCTF{...}`), extract and display the flag, then exit.  
  - **Failure**: If the response prompts for another guess, continue to the next one.  
  - **Exhaustion**: If all 50 guesses fail, the server will indicate the attempts are exhausted, and the script exits.

### How It Works
- **Timing Synchronization**: Capturing `t_start` just before connecting minimizes the gap between local and server time.  
- **Delay Adjustment**: The `estimated_delay` shifts the guess window to account for latency, ensuring the server’s timestamp falls within the 50 ms range.  
- **Token Generation**: The `get_random` function replicates the server’s logic, using the same alphabet and seed-based random selection.  
- **Automation**: `pwntools` handles the connection and communication, systematically testing guesses until the flag is retrieved.

### Notes
- **Delay Tuning**: If the script fails, adjust `estimated_delay` (e.g., 10–20 ms) based on your network latency.  
- **Flag Format**: The flag will be in the format `picoCTF{...}`, typically revealed after a correct guess.  

This solution efficiently exploits the predictable time-based seed to retrieve the flag within the 50-guess limit, making it a reliable approach to solving "Chronohack."

# Generate 50 token guesses

        # Check for success
        elif "Congratulations" in line or "flag" in line.lower():

            else:

                print(f"Flag: {flag}")
            r.close()
            exit(0)
        
        # Check for failure after all attempts
        elif "exhausted" in line or "too many" in line:
            print("All attempts used up.")
            r.close()
            exit(1)

print("Failed to find the correct token within 50 attempts.")
