# EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN??

## Challenge Information
- **Category:** Crypto
- **Description:** This service provides you an encrypted flag. Can you decrypt it with just N & e? Connect to the program with netcat: ```$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 51434``` The program's source code can be downloaded here.
- **Hints:** 
    - How much do we trust randomness?
    - Notice anything interesting about N?
    - Try comparing N across multiple requests

## Analysis

Let's determine the parameters:

```cmd
$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 51434
N: 15956406145787045697045836875872205963351137069379098306075049231425780726092381593192489624682718392952485959590857931900862464349656345859605041845071886
e: 65537
cyphertext: 15424440168528358995286123614851011350015209432001800630444797091190078867982876803870765184208807547755974974623583704791108443351513009891970935033143305
```

The security of RSA depends on the difficulty of factoring $N = p \cdot q$
into its two prime factors.

Observing that N is even, we can infer that one of the primes is 2â€”a perfect match for the challenge title!

$$
\begin{aligned}
p &= 2\\
q &= N/2\\
\phi_N &= (p-1)(q-1)\\
       &= q - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Given that \( e = 65537 \), we calculate the decryption key as:
$d = \text{inverse\_mod}(e, \phi_N)$
Then, the plaintext is recovered by computing:
$\text{plaintext} = \text{pow}(\text{ciphertext}, d, N)$

The sage code is [here](de_rsa.sage):

Thus, we obtain the flag:

`picoCTF{tw0_1$_pr!m381772be5}`
